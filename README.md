METARET – a Meta Analysis of the External Validity of Risk Elicitation
Tasks
================
Paolo Crosetto
This version: June 2019

This project is about the **external validity** of **risk elicitation
tasks** (RETs) – i.e. their ability to predict self-reported or
real-world behavior.

This repository contains

  - **data** contributed from each of several *contributed papers* by
    experimental economists and social psychologists.
  - **code** to format each original dataset into a common format for
    later analysis
  - **results** in the form of plots and tables (*work in progress*)
  - **code** for an interactive shiny app that will give the users the
    possibility to explore the data by themselves (*completely TODO*)
