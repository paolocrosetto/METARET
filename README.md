METARET – a Meta Analysis of the External Validity of Risk Elicitation
Tasks
================
Paolo Crosetto
This version: June 2019

This repository hosts all the development files of the METARET project
on the **external validity** of **risk elicitation tasks** (RETs) –
i.e. their ability to predict self-reported or real-world behavior.

## Aim of the project

## Resources

The project can count on:

  - a **web site** [(here)]() setting up the aim of the project,
    tracking its ongoing devlopment of the project, and giving
    information on how to contribute.
  - a **shiny interactive app**
    [(here)](https://paolocrosetto.shinyapps.io/METARET/) where the data
    accumulated so far can be explored and visualised
  - an **OSF page** [(here)](https://osf.io/h2z56/) where the project
    has been pre-registered
  - this **github repository** where the real work is done and updated,
    and that contains
      - **data** from each of several *contributed papers* by
        experimental economists and social psychologists.
      - **code** to format each original dataset into a common format
        for later analysis
      - **results** in the form of plots and tables (*work in progress*)
      - **code** for the interactive shiny app (*work in progress*)

## First look at the results

As a first step, I compute the (Pearson) correlation of each RET to
(each of a series of) self-reported risk measures.

Each task is represented by a point estimate + confidence interval. Here
are the results of correlations between several tasks and:

  - the SOEP risk question
  - the DOSPERT scale and its subscales

The plots and analyses are updated for each new contributed paper.
