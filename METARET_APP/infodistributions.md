Here we show the comparisons between distributions. We limited the risk aversion parameter between **-1.5** and **2.5** for a better visualization. The dotted red line shows the point of indifference between risk loving and risk avoidance. At the bottom of the distribution is a whisker box with median, lower and upper quartiles.
