**An ordered lottery choice task by Eckel and Grossman (EG) (2002, 2008a)**

In ordered lottery selection tasks, subjects are asked to pick one out of an ordered set of lotteries. Then the lottery is played and the subject paid accordingly. A risk-neutral subject should choose lottery 5, as it yields the higher expected value.
