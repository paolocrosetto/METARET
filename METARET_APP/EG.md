**An ordered lottery choice task by Binswanger (1980) and Eckel and Grossman (EG) (2002)**

This task was first introduced by [Binswanger in 1980](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/1240194?casa_token=k6Bekf_xAXEAAAAA:LhiW-YmzkdlZzG4kbWUuG01feCKBu7Rt8BzrW5l39SDKHiHmVRvem3wIbhXIb9-Fc3OGeiomMOR4r-k) to elicit risk attitudes in rural India, then adapted to the experimental economics laboratory by [Eckel and Grossman in 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513802000971?via%3Dihub). 

Subjects are asked to pick one out of an ordered set of lotteries. The lotteries are all characterized by 50-50 probabilities, and an increasing expected value along with an increasing variance. The chosen lottery is played and the subject paid accordingly. In the more widespread implementation, the one introduced by Eckel and Grossman, the subject chooses among 6 lotteries, over 5 of which the EV increases, while in the sixth only the variance increases. The first 5 lotteries allow to identify different degrees of risk aversion, while the 6th singles out risk neutral and risk lovers.
