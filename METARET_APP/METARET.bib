  abstract={The Random Utility Model (RUM) and the Random Preference Model (RPM) are important tools in the economist?s toolbox when estimating preference functionals from experimental data. In an important recent paper in this journal, Apesteguia and Ballester (2018) cautioned decision theorists against using the RUM, suggesting that the RPM may be preferable. This short note comments on this paper, and concludes that RUM does not suffer from the drawbacks suggested in their paper.},

abstract = {We present experimental evidence on how pro-sociality, trust and attitudes towards risk and ambiguity evolved over the six weeks following the imposition of stringent Covid-19 related lockdown measures in the Hubei province of China. We compare incentivized economic decision-making in a baseline sample, collected pre-epidemic, with a series of repeated cross-sectional samples drawn from the same population between January and March, 2020. We find high rates of altruism, cooperation and aversion to risk taking under ambiguity in the immediate aftermath of the lockdown, while trust is significantly below its baseline level. Risk attitudes also differ in the post-lockdown sample, with decreased risk tolerance in the loss domain and lesser risk aversion in the gain domain. We further uncover significant transitory effects for trust and risk aversion around the date of a high-profile whistleblower’s death from Covid-19. Our findings suggest that the onset of a public health crisis may have unintended consequences for economic preferences that determine population compliance with interventions designed to reduce the spread of a novel coronavirus.}

abstract = {We use a lab-in-the-field experiment to examine how personal experience of good or bad luck and information about the behavior of others influence the risk taking behavior of small-scale fishers in Tanzania. These fishers make many risky decisions in their daily lives, and a better understanding of the factors influencing risky decisions is important from both a policy and scientific perspective. Our results show a slight tendency for fishers to take more risk in a lottery if they have been unlucky in another game shortly before. Risk taking is enhanced by social information when fishers learn that others have taken more risk. This is true although risks are independent and the fishers do not know whether the risk taking of others has ultimately paid off.}

Previous research has shown that some consistency of choices with economic rationality can be captured by permanent cognitive ability. No other known study however has examined how a temporary load in subjects’ working memory can affect economic rationality. Using two controlled laboratory experiments, we exogenously vary cognitive load by asking subjects to memorise a number while they undertake an induced budget allocation task (Choi et al., 2007a, b). Using a number of manipulation checks, we verify that cognitive load has adverse effects on subjects’ performance in reasoning tasks. However, we find no effect in any of the goodness-of-fit measures that measure consistency of subjects’ choices with the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference (GARP), despite having a sample size large enough to detect even small differences between treatments with 80\% power. We also find no effect on first-order stochastic dominance and risk preferences. Our finding suggests that economic rationality can be attained even when subjects are placed under temporary working memory load, despite the fact that the load has adverse effects in reasoning tasks.},

Depending on the task, we find that less than half of the participants behave as if risk neutral. In fact, when we compare the distribution of choices, we find no significant difference to standard experiments that did not use the binary lottery procedure. Using a structural model we find modest evidence that the binary lottery procedure might move participants at least slightly towards risk neutrality.}

	Notably, disagreements about the use of deception are generally not

	while the other side argues that deception has little negative impact
	and, under certain conditions, can even enhance validity. These divergent

	interdisciplinary research and discovery, create hostilities between
	disciplines and researchers, and can negatively impact the careers
	of scientists who may be sanctioned for following the norms of their
	home discipline. We present two experimental studies aimed at addressing
	the issue empirically. Study 1 addresses the effects of direct exposure
	to deception, while Study 2 addresses the effects of indirect exposure
	to deception. Results from both studies suggest that deception does

	traits and traits of cognition. Women are more risk-averse than men.
	Over an initial range, women require no further compensation for
	the introduction of ambiguity but men do. At greater levels of ambiguity,
	women have the same marginal distaste for increased ambiguity as
	men. Psychological variables account for some of the interpersonal
	variation in risk aversion. They explain none of the differences

  abstract = {Regret helps to optimize decision behaviour. It can be defined as
	a rational emotion. Several recent neurobiological studies have confirmed
	the interface between emotion and cognition at which regret is located
	and documented its role in decision behaviour. These data give credibility
	to the incorporation of regret in decision theory that had been proposed
	by economists in the 1980s. However, finer distinctions are required
	in order to get a better grasp of how regret and behaviour influence
	each other. Regret can be defined as a predictive error signal but
	this signal does not necessarily transpose into a decision-weight
	influencing behaviour. Clinical studies on several types of patients
	show that the processing of an error signal and its influence on
	subsequent behaviour can be dissociated. We propose a general understanding
	of how regret and decision-making are connected in terms of regret
	being modulated by rational antecedents of choice. Regret and the
	modification of behaviour on its basis will depend on the criteria
	of rationality involved in decision-making. We indicate current and
	prospective lines of research in order to refine our views on how
	regret contributes to optimal decision-making.}

	an increase in the expected value of a risk due to increasing the

	activity of healthy adults can modulate the influence of stake magnitude
	on decisions to persistently gamble after incurring a loss. In this
	study, we tested for modulation of this effect by MPH in 40 healthy
	human adults. In a double-blind experiment, 20 subjects received
	20 mg of MPH, while 20 matched controls received a placebo. All were
	provided with 30 rounds of opportunities to accept an incurred loss
	from their assets or opt for a “double-or-nothing�? gamble that
	would either avoid or double it. Rounds began with a variable loss
	that would double with every failed gamble until it was accepted,
	recovered, or reached a specified maximum. Probability of recovery
	on any gamble was low and ambiguous. Subjects receiving placebo gambled
	less as the magnitude of the stake was raised and as the magnitude
	of accumulated loss escalated over the course of the task. In contrast,
	subjects treated with MPH gambled at a consistent rate, well above
	chance, across all stakes and trials. Trait reward responsiveness
	also reduced the impact of high stakes. The findings suggest that
	elevated catecholamine activity by MPH can disrupt inhibitory influences
	on persistent risky choice in healthy adults.},

We find that measures of risk attitude are related to behavior in laboratory financial decisions and the most complex measures are outperformed by simpler measures. However, measures of risk attitude are not related to risk-taking in the field, calling into question the methods currently used for the purpose of measuring actual risk preferences. We conclude that while the external validity of measures of risk attitude holds in closely related frameworks, this validity is compromised in more remote settings.},

	the simple binary mechanism produces results that closely match the
	patterns found in previous work, although the levels of risk-taking

	it provides individuals with moral license to engage in self�?interested
	behavior, thereby exacerbating biases. We follow up on this research
	and seek to determine whether other institutional factors may negate
	the potentially harmful effects of disclosure. We conduct a laboratory
	experiment, focusing on behavior in an investor/financial adviser
	dyad, including important representative features in this setting.
	Our results suggest that disclosure is not necessarily detrimental.
	We find that investors are better off when conflicts of interest
	are disclosed and sanctions are available, even though initiating
	sanctions is costly to investors. Under such conditions, advisers’
	bias is dampened markedly.},

We show by means of a simulation exercise that part of the often observed heterogeneity of estimates across tasks is due to task-specific measurement error induced by the mere mechanics of the tasks. We run a replication experiment in a homogeneous subject pool using a between subjects one-shot design. Results shows that the task estimates vary over and above what can be explained by the simulations. We investigate the possibility the tasks elicit different types of preferences, rather than simply provide a different measure of the same preferences. In particular, the availability of a riskless alternative plays a prominent role helping to explain part of the differences in the estimated preferences.},

	to influence relative bargaining weight. We also find that individuals

	siege, sequential attack and defense. The attacker’s objective
	is to successfully win at least one battle, while the defender’s
	objective is to win every battle. Theoretically, the defender either
	folds immediately or, if his valuation is sufficiently high and the
	number of battles is sufficiently small, then he has a constant incentive
	to fight in each battle. Attackers respond to defense with diminishing
	assaults over time. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the
	authors’ experimental results indicate that the probability of
	successful defense increases in the defenders valuation and it decreases
	in the overall number of battles in the contest. However, the defender
	engages in the contest significantly more often than predicted and
	the aggregate expenditures by both parties exceed predicted levels.
	Moreover, both defenders and attackers actually increase the intensity
	of the fight as they approach the end of the contest.},

  abstract = {One of the goals of procurement is to establish a competitive price
	while affording the buyer some flexibility in selecting the suppliers
	to deal with. Reverse auctions do not have this flexibility, because
	it is the auction rules and not the buyer that determines the winner.
	In practice, however, hybrid mechanisms that remove some suppliers
	and a corresponding amount of demand from the auction market are
	quite common. We find that in theory such hybrid mechanisms increase
	competition and make buyers better off as long as suppliers are willing
	to accept noncompetitive contracts. It turns out that suppliers often
	do because under a wide variety of conditions, these contracts have
	a positive expected profit. Our theory relies on two behavioral assumptions:
	(1) bidders in a multiunit uniform-price reverse auction will follow
	the dominant strategy of bidding truthfully, and (2) the suppliers
	who have been removed from the market will accept noncompetitive
	contracts that have a positive expected profit. Our experiment demonstrates
	that bidders in the auction behave very close to following the dominant
	strategy regardless of whether this auction is a stand-alone or a
	part of a hybrid mechanism. We also find that suppliers accept noncompetitive
	contracts sufficiently often (although not always) to make the hybrid
	mechanism outperform the reverse auction in the laboratory as well
	as in theory.},

	Public assistance programs have two entangled effects on society:

	experiment to determine how individuals’ responses to the environment
	are related to their self-expressed political ideology and their
	self-interest. The findings support the hypothesis that ideology
	is associated with a person’s willingness to use redistribution
	to reduce income inequality that is caused by luck, but it is not
	related to preferences for inequality that are not related to luck.},

	Preferences over social risk can be closely approximated by individual

	of other group members. We find no evidence that subjects systematically
	reveal different risk attitudes in a social setting with no prior
	knowledge about the risk preferences of others compared to when they
	solely bear the consequences of the decision. However, we also find
	that subjects are significantly more risk averse when they know the

While most of the literature on dynamic risk restricts attention to positively skewed gambles, subjects in our experiment tend to choose negatively skewed lotteries. This allows us to study dynamic risk preferences in an environment that the literature has not analyzed. We find evidence of the reinforcement effect—individuals take on more risk after a gain and take on less risk after a loss. Furthermore, we exogenously vary whether these outcomes are “realized” or on paper, according to the distinction put forth by Imas (2016). We find little difference in the responses to realized and paper outcomes in environments of negatively skewed risk.}

	from evolutionary psychology and empirical evidence from experimental
	economics. Although there has been extensive prior research in both
	fields, there remains a large disconnect between the source of gender
	differences in pro-sociality and experimental research aimed at informing
	cooperation and generosity. Thus, the main contribution of our article
	is to bridge this gap by arguing that differences in male and female
	motives for pro-sociality stem, at least in part, from gender differences
	in mating strategies. In particular, we discuss gender differences
	in: (i) signaling behaviors; (ii) conformance to social norms; and
	(iii) approaches toward resolving intra- and inter-group dilemmas.
	This article may be a useful resource for those hoping to gain a
	better understanding of the foundations of gender differences in
	pro-sociality; likewise, it draws useful attention to empirical research
	aimed at promoting charitable giving and enhancing resource allocation
	efficiency. (JEL codes: D03, D64)},

	An extensive literature shows that people deviate from rationality

	in difficult criminal cases, miscarriages of justice occur, but this
	is hard to study in the field. In a laboratory experiment, we examine
	the relationship between evidence of which the diagnostic value is
	known, subjective probability of guilt and errors in verdicts for
	abstract criminal cases. We look at two situations: (1) all evidence
	is given and (2) evidence can be acquired. In both situations, verdicts
	are inaccurate. For given evidence, errors are biased toward the
	most serious type, unfounded conviction. In the situation where evidence
	can be acquired, participants do not acquire enough which results
	in many mistakes, evenly divided over unfounded convictions and unfounded
	acquittals. We suggest ways to reduce error (JEL C91, K14, K40).},

	abstract = "A body of literature based primarily on experiments suggests that cognitive ability and risk aversion are inversely related. In contrast, studies using observational data often find that lower ability, or lower income, is positively related to risky behaviors. One potential explanation for the conflicting conclusions is that experimental studies tend to measure risk attitudes by presenting subjects with choices between an option with a certain outcome and an option characterized by risk, which requires computation and, hence, cognitive effort. Additionally, these studies have primarily relied on the use of hypothetical choices. I use an experiment to test whether this frequently-used method of measuring risk preferences is biased toward finding results that indicate that individuals with lower cognitive ability are more risk averse than individuals with higher cognitive ability. I find that the inverse relationship between risk aversion and cognitive ability is not robust and that high-ability subjects may misrepresent their preferences when they face hypothetical choices. Also, similar to earlier studies, I find that low-ability subjects are more likely to make errors and show that the availability of a certain option reduces errors for the lowest-ability subjects.",

abstract = {We describe a risk protocol that combines the rigor of economic studies of risk with the ecological validity of tasks from psychology. Despite a wealth of experimental contributions on risk preferences, stemming from a variety of elicitation tasks, the external validity of standard measures of risk is questionable. In this study we focus on a risk task – the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) – which is highly successful in predicting health-related risk behaviors such as alcohol use, drug use, smoking, unprotected sex, driving without a seatbelt, and stealing. The BART is not commonly used by economic scholars because of concerns that participants may not adequately comprehend uncertainty associated with the task and because of the resulting difficulty in relating participants’ choices to standard risk models. To answer these concerns and build on associations with real world risk, we designed a modified BART, which we will refer to as the Balloon Economic Risk Protocol (BERP). In this protocol, participants observe the distribution of pop points prior to the task to create a more consistent knowledge base. We then use a belief elicitation technique to produce a user-generated prior distribution of balloon pops. Using these measures, we compare participants’ behavior to the expected-value optimum to provide a link to standard models of risk. In accordance with past economic literature, we found that participants’ BERP-generated risk preferences revealed mild risk aversion on average, and correlated with a self-report questionnaire on drinking, drug use, and smoking behavior.}

Inspired by the multitude of ways used to elicit risk preferences, we conduct a holistic investigation of the most prevalent method, the multiple price list (MPL) and its derivations. In accordance with previous literature, we find that revealed preferences differ under various and even the same versions of the MPL. Thus, an arbitrary selection of a particular risk assessment method can lead to biased results especially if researchers investigate its connection to other phenomena. In order to resolve this issue, we determine the most stable version of the MPL by using multiple measures of within-method consistency, and the version with the highest forecast accuracy by using behavior in two economically relevant games as benchmarks. A derivation of the well-known method by Holt and Laury (2002), where the highest payoff is varied instead of probabilities, emerges as the best MPL method in both dimensions. (authors' abstract)},

Specifically, our study lets experimental participants trade assets characterized by varying shapes of return distributions. While common mean-variance models predict identical prices for most of our assets, we find trading prices to differ significantly. Assets that are perceived as being less risky on average (despite having identical volatility) trade at significantly higher prices. Individually, traders who perceive a certain asset to be less risky are also net buyers on average. With regard to different risk measures, our results show that the probability of a loss is the strongest predictor of transaction prices and risk perception. All these results hold also for experienced traders and when traders can trade two assets at the same time.}

  abstract  = {To what extent is there a general factor of risk preference, R, akin to g, the general factor of intelligence? Can risk preference be regarded as a stable psychological trait? These conceptual issues persist because few attempts have been made to integrate multiple risk-taking measures, particularly measures from different and largely unrelated measurement traditions (self-reported propensity measures assessing stated preferences, incentivized behavioral measures eliciting revealed preferences, and frequency measures assessing actual risky activities). Adopting a comprehensive psychometric approach (1507 healthy adults completing 39 risk-taking measures, with a subsample of 109 participants completing a retest session after 6 months), we provide a substantive empirical foundation to address these issues, finding that correlations between propensity and behavioral measures were weak. Yet, a general factor of risk preference, R, emerged from stated preferences and generalized to specific and actual real-world risky activities (for example, smoking). Moreover, R proved to be highly reliable across time, indicative of a stable psychological trait. Our findings offer a first step toward a general mapping of the construct risk preference, which encompasses both general and domain-specific components, and have implications for the assessment of risk preference in the laboratory and in the wild.},

This puts previous studies that found a negative relation between cognitive ability and risk aversion into perspective and in particular raises the question of how to achieve robust inference in this domain. This paper shows that using structural estimation that models heterogeneity of noise in combination with a balanced design allows us to mitigate the bias problem. Our estimations show that cognitive ability is related to noisy behavior rather than risk preferences. We also find age and education to be strongly related to noise, but the personality characteristics obtained using the Big Five inventory, are less related to noise and more robustly correlated to risk preferences.},

The estimated coefficient of relative risk aversion, gamma, varies widely across individual subjects (consistent with EUH) and also across elicitation tasks (inconsistent with direct implementation of EUH). An alternative nonparametric measure of risk preferences displays similar patterns. The two risk preference measures are highly correlated with each other for each elicitation task. Each separate measure varies widely across individual subjects and across elicitation tasks, with low to nil correlation between BL tasks and HL tasks. Some of the variation across tasks can be explained by attributes such as graphical vs text representation that have no role in decision theory.},
