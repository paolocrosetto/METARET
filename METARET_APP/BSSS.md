**Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS)**

[The Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS)](https://arc.psych.wisc.edu/self-report/sensation-seeking-scale-sss/) is a forty-item questionnaire. The SSS has four primary scales (Disinhibition, Boredom Susceptibility, Thrill and Adventure Seeking, Experience Seeking) and one total score.

* Disinhibition represents the desire for social and sexual disinhibition
as expressed in social drinking, partying, and variety in sexual partners.
* Boredom Susceptibility represents an aversion to repetition, routine, and dull people, and restlessness when things are unchanging.
* Thrill and Adventure Seeking contains items expressing a desire to engage in sports or other activities involving speed or danger.
* Experience Seeking represents the seeking of experiences through the mind
and senses, travel, and a nonconforming life-style.

Here we show the total score for all the four scales.
