**Barratt Impulsiveness Scale**

The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale ([BIS-11; Patton et al., 1995](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3805371/)) is a questionnaire designed to assess the personality/behavioral construct of impulsiveness. It is composed of 30 items describing common impulsive or non-impulsive (for reverse scored items) behaviors and preferences.

Items are scored on a 4-point scale:

* Rarely/Never = 1
* Occasionally = 2
* Often = 3
* Almost Always/Always = 4

The total result is the sum of all the scores.
