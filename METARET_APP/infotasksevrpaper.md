Here we show the mean and the standard deviation of mean for the risk aversion parameter (CRRA) for each task regarding observations of each article. We limited CRRA between **-1.5** and **2.5** to avoid the outliers. The standard deviation of the mean (SEM) was calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the root of the sample size. The standard error of the mean is a metric for determining how widely values in a dataset are spread out. The results are sorted upon the calculation of mean for each article.
