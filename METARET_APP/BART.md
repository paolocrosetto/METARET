**Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) by Lejuez et al. (2002)** 

The balloon can pop at any time between the first pump and the maximum balloon size. This means that the balloon can pop on the first pump and will pop with certainty at the maximum balloon size. On each trial the pop point is randomly drawn from a uniform distribution between one and the maximum balloon size. Participants can ‘cash in’ their accumulated tokens before the balloon’s pop point.
