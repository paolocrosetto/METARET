**Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) by Lejuez et al. (2002)** 

The BART is a task where a draw without replacement from an urn is presented to subjects as a balloon that can pop at any time, and in which subjects gain money for each pump. The task was first introduced by [Lejuez et al](https://doi.org/10.1037//1076-898x.8.2.75). The balloon can pop at any time between the first pump and the maximum balloon size. This means that the balloon can pop on the first pump and will pop with certainty at the maximum balloon size. On each trial the pop point is randomly drawn from a uniform distribution between one and the maximum balloon size. Participants can ‘cash in’ their accumulated tokens before the balloon’s pop point.

The subjects are usually not informed about the properties of the underlying urn -- i.e. the Balloon is inherently an ambiguous task. Moreover, the balloon popping is usually live, that is, we can observe truncated data if a balloon pops before the preferred stopping point for a subject. These features, present in the original Balloon study, have been widely altered, to allow for risk rather than ambiguity (by showing the underlying urn and distribution) and by avoiding the truncation of data.
