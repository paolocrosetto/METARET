**The German Socio-Economic Panel Study risk question (SOEP, Wagner et al. 2007)**

The SOEP measure consists of a direct question, extracted from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (Wagner et al. 2007). It asks subjects to report, on a 0–10 scale, ‘How do you see yourself: are you generally a person who is fully prepared to take risks or do you try to avoid taking risks?’

**The Domain-Specific Risk-Taking Scale (Blais and Weber 2006, DOSPERT)**

The Domain-Specific Risk-Taking Scale (Blais and Weber 2006) is a 30-item risk questionnaire spanning several different domains in which risk attitudes can play a role: ethical, financial (further decomposed into gambling and investment), health/safety, social, and recreational decisions.
