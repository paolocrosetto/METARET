# METARET: A META analysis of Risk Elicitation Tasks

## Aim and scope

This website collects, displays and explores a **large dataset of risk elicitation experiments** carried out around the world, in the lab or in the field, in the last two to three decades.

The aim of this project is to **collect into one place** and make available to the community a wealth of data on elicited risk attitudes. 

Right now, the site proposes:

- a presentation of each and every task and questionnaire, encyclopedia-style, giving details, links, a distribution of elicited risk attitudes and related papers;
- a host of summary statistics and comparisons, within- and betwenn-subjects, within- and across-tasks;
- data from risk-related questionnaires;
- correlations between tasks and questionnaires;
- an exploration of differences in risk attitudes by gender and age;
- the possibility to download the full dataset.
