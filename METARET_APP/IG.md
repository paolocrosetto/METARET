**The Investment Game (IG) by Gneezy and Potters (1997)** 

Subjects have to decide how to allocate a given endowment of X euro between a safe account and a risky investment that usually yields 2.5 or 3 times the amount invested or zero with equal probability. The expected value of the risky asset being higher than 1, a risk neutral should invest everything, and the amount allocated allows to measure different degrees of risk aversion. The task is usually directly framed as an investment, and was introduced as a test of myopic loss aversion [(paper in QJE, 1997)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951248).

The task has been widely used to elicit risk attitudes, especially in developing countries, due to its intuitive nature. It usually yields detectable gender differences. It is limited by design to cover only risk averse preferences, and, in its usual parametrization, cannot distinguish between risk neutral and slightly risk averse subjects.
