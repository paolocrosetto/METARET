METARET collects data of papers that have run:

* any **lottery-based RET** (incentivized or not) 
* any **other measure of risk** attitudes (questionnaire, bids in an auction, self-reported, implied by behavior in another game (insurance, trust...)) 
* any **self-declared real-world risky behavior**.

If you want to contribute, send your paper, data, and a data description file to: [Paolo Crosetto](mailto:paolo.crosetto@inrae.fr).
