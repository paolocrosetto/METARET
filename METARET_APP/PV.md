**The payoff varying task by Drichoutis & Lusk (2016)** 

The Holt and Laury task was introduced in a [2022 paper on the American Economic Review](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282802762024700), and it is by far the most-used and most-cited risk elicitation task in experimental economics. 

[Drichoutis and Lusk](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-02272-001) showed that widely used multiple price list introduced by Holt and Laury is likely more accurate at eliciting the shape of the probability weighting function, and they constructed a different multiple price list that is likely more accurate at eliciting the shape of the utility function.  Thus, by combining information from different multiple price lists, greater predictive performance can be achieved.
