**The Domain-Specific Risk-Taking Scale (Weber et al 2002, DOSPERT)**

The Domain-Specific Risk-Taking Scale was introduced by [Weber et al in 2002](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/sites/decisionsciences/files/files/dospert%202002.PDF) is a 30- (or 40-) item risk questionnaire spanning several different domains in which risk attitudes can play a role: ethical, financial (further decomposed into gambling and investment), health/safety, social, and recreational decisions.

Subjects answer on Likert scales from 1 to 7. Answers are aggregated and averaged to form a single score (DOSPERT-all) or individual scores for the domain-specific subscales. The questionnaire includes also a risk perception scale. This is nt widely used in experimental economics; results here cover the risk taking DOSPERT only. 

The questions, translations, grading asd scoring boards can be found on the dedicated [DOSPERT website](https://sites.google.com/decisionsciences.columbia.edu/dospert/)
