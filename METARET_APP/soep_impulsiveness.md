**The German Socio-Economic Panel Study financial risk question (SOEP, Wagner et al. 2007)**

The SOEP measure consists of a direct question, extracted from the [German Socio-Economic Panel Study (Wagner et al. 2007)](https://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.450791.de/publikationen/soeppapers/2007_0001/the_german_socio-economic_panel_study__soep___scope__evolution_and_enhancements.html).

It is a specialized subquestion of the general SOEP impulsiveness question, and it asks subjects to report, on a 0–10 scale, "Do you generally think things over for a long time before acting – in other words, are you not impulsive at all? Or do you generally act without thinking things over a long time – in other words, are you very impulsive?"

The measure was popularized among experimental economists by a [paper by Dohmen et al. on the JEEA 2011](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1542-4774.2011.01015.x), that compared it to a lottery-based laboratory measure with decent results.
