**Bomb Risk Elicitation Task (BRET) by Crosetto and Filippin (2013)** 

Subjects decide how many boxes to collect out of 100, one of which containing a "delayed time bomb". Earnings increase linearly with the number of boxes accumulated but are zero if the bomb is also collected. The presence f the bomb is revealed only *after* the task, thus avoiding truncation of the data. 

The BRET was introduced in an article in the [Journal of Risk and Uncertainty in 2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11166-013-9170-z) and has recently been widely used in experiments with kids, in developing countries, as well as in the lab.
