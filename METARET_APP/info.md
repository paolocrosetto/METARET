# METARET: A META analysis of Risk Elicitation Tasks

## Aim and scope

This website collects, displays and explores a **large dataset of risk elicitation experiments** carried out around the world, in the lab or in the field, in the last two to three decades.

The aim of this project is to **collect into one place** and make available to the community a wealth of data on elicited risk attitudes. 

Right now, the site proposes:

- a presentation of each and every task and questionnaire, encyclopedia-style, giving details, links, a distribution of elicited risk attitudes and related papers;
- a host of summary statistics and comparisons, within- and betwenn-subjects, within- and across-tasks;
- data from risk-related questionnaires;
- correlations between tasks and questionnaires;
- an exploration of differences in risk attitudes by gender and age;
- the possibility to download the full dataset.


## Future developments

With time, the website will also add more features. The overall aim is to:

- **document exhaustively** the scope and limits of the external validity of different RETs;
- provide a detailed **map of which features** of a RET are more conducive to external validity;
- serve as a basis for the development of a more predictive lottery-based RET.

In particular, each Risk Elicitation Task will be broken down by its characteristics (number of choices, expected value, outcomes, probabilities, the presence of losses, cetain vs. uncertain outcomes, ...) and an "explore" section will be available where the dataset could be organized by any and each of these features, to explore different hypothesis about consistency and external validity. 

## Contribute!

METARET collects data of papers that have run:
* any **lottery-based RET** (incentivized or not)
* any **other measure of risk** attitudes (questionnaire, bids in an auction, self-reported, implied by behavior in another game (insurance, trustâ€¦))
* any **self-declared real-world risky behavior**.
