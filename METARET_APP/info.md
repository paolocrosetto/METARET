# Aim of the project

The accurate measure of **risk preferences** is of large importance in both theoretical and applied work. Despite this importance, increasing experimental evidence points to the fact that the behavioral measures we use to elicit risk attitudes have **low external validity**.

The aim of **METARET** – the Meta-analysis of the external validity of RETs – is to collect in a single, public, open repository all the data pertaining to the external validity of RETs. Its objectives are to:  
* document exhaustively the scope and limits of the external validity of different RETs.
* provide a detailed map of which features of a RET are more conducive to external validity validity.
* serve as a basis for the development of a more predictive lottery-based RET (French ANR grant under submission).

METARET collects data of papers that have run:
* any **lottery-based RET** (incentivized or not)
* any **other measure of risk** attitudes (questionnaire, bids in an auction, self-reported, implied by behavior in another game (insurance, trust…))
* any **self-declared real-world risky behavior**.
