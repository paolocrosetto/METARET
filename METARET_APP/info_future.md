## Future developments

With time, the website will also add more features. The overall aim is to:

- **document exhaustively** the scope and limits of the external validity of different RETs;
- provide a detailed **map of which features** of a RET are more conducive to external validity;
- serve as a basis for the development of a more predictive lottery-based RET.

In particular, each Risk Elicitation Task will be broken down by its characteristics (number of choices, expected value, outcomes, probabilities, the presence of losses, cetain vs. uncertain outcomes, ...) and an "explore" section will be available where the dataset could be organized by any and each of these features, to explore different hypothesis about consistency and external validity.
