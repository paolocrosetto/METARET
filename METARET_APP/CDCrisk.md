**Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (CDC, 2001)**

[The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5104a1.htm) monitors six categories of health-related behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of death and disability among youth and adults, including:

* Behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence
* Sexual behaviors related to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV infection
* Alcohol and other drug use
* Tobacco use
* Unhealthy dietary behaviors
* Inadequate physical activity

In our database we collected the answers for the **Behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence** category.
