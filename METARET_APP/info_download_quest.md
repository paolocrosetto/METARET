Here you can inspect and download **the full dataset** of the contributed papers. 

Each contributed dataset was cleaned in order to yield the same variables. Variables vary by questionnaire, and in all cases where the questionnaire boils down to a single value, that single value is reported and not the individual replies to each individual question that composes the scale.
