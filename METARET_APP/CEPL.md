**Certainty equivalent method (CEPL)** 

Under this acronym we grou here a series of tasks that are characterized by a series of choices between a certain amount and a lottery. Methods vary in the details of what is moving along the series of choices, but their general aim is to pin down the *certainty equivalent* of a lottery.

In some implementations, it is the certain amount that changes, and the lottery stays the same. In others, it is the other way around; and the lotteries might change in outcomes or in probability. But these methods all pitch a lottery against a certain amount.
