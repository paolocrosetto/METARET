**Balloon Economic Risk Protocol (BERP)**

The BERP is an attempt to make the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) more appealing to experimental economists, by controlling for beliefs, avoiding truncation, and inserting the standard BART metaphor and task into a more rigorous setting. The aim is to retain the peculiar characteristic of BART -- its correlation with health outcomes -- in a setting that can be safely used by experimental economists.

The BERP is a complete design, proposed by [Fairley et al (Journal of Economic Psychology 73, pp. 15-33, 2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167487018302708). Subjects observe the distribution of pop points before the task, beliefs on the pop points are elicited, and the elicited risk attitude is corrected by the stated beliefs.
