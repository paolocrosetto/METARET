**The multiple price list by Holt and Laury (HL) (2002)** 

The Holt and Laury task was introduced in a [2022 paper on the American Economic Review](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282802762024700), and it is by far the most-used and most-cited risk elicitation task in experimental economics. 

It is based on the concept of a price list, whereby subjects have to make a series of binary choices among alternatives that stay largely the same but that change along one attribute (for instance, the price). 

The HL implementation is an ordered list of binary choices between lotteries, with Option *A* being safer than Option *B*. Along the table the probability of the good outcome increases, for both lotteries, all other thing being equal. The subjects must make a choice for each pair of lotteries and, if consistent, should start with the safe option and at some point switch to the risky option. The switching point captures the risk aversion of the subject. In the original table, a risk-neutral subject should start with Option *A* and switch to *B* from the fifth choice on. The task has been subject to intense scrutiny and several variations have been proposed, keeping constant the "price-list" component.
