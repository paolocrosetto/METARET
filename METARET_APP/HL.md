**The multiple price list by Holt and Laury (HL) (2002)** 
  
Ordered list of binary choices between lotteries, with Option *A* being safer than Option *B*. The subjects must make a choice for each pair of lotteries and, if consistent, should at some point switch to the risky option. The switching point captures the risk aversion of the subject. A risk-neutral subject should start with Option *A* and switch to *B* from the fifth choice on.
