**Alcohol Use DIsorders Test**

[The AUDIT questionnaire(Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test)](https://nida.nih.gov/sites/default/files/audit.pdf) is a simple 10-question test developed by the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/fr) to determine if a person is at risk of alcohol addiction. The first three questions deal with the patient's consumption, questions 4 to 6 with alcohol dependence and questions 7 to 10 with alcohol-related problems.
- A score of 8 or less for men and 7 or less for women indicates low or innocuous risk
- A score between 7 and 12 for men and between 6 and 12 for women indicates risky or problematic consumption
- A score above 12 indicates probable alcohol dependence
