## The topic



## Nothing new

![](Presentation_ESA_files/Slovic1962.png){width=800px}

- this is from Slovic 1962
- correlation among now-deceased measures of risk is low
- notice the wrong signs

## But still

# Elicited risk attitudes

## tasks

## papers covered

## across tasks: task-specific

## within tasks: detail-specific

## within tasks: replication-specific

## questionnaires

# Correlation among RETs

## papers covered

## rather low across the board

## blah

# Correlation with questionnaires

## papers covered

## results

# Why?

## Noise

## Risk perception

## Theory

# Where do we go from here?

## Contribute to the meta-analysis!

## Lookign fro patterns

## Tackling noise

## Tackling perceptions

## Tackling theory

# Thanks!
