## Aim of the project

The accurate measure of **risk preferences** is of large importance in
both theoretical and applied work. Despite this importance, increasing
experimental evidence points to the fact that the behavioral measures we
use to elicit risk attitudes have **low external validity**.

The aim of **METARET** – the Meta-analysis of the external validity of RETs
– is to collect in a single, public, open repository all the data
pertaining to the external validity of RETs. Its objectives are to

  - **document exhaustively** the scope and limits of the external
    validity of different RETs.
  - provide a **detailed map** of which **features** of a RET are more
    conducive to external validity validity.
  - serve as a basis for the **development** of a more predictive
    lottery-based RET (*French ANR grant under submission*).

METARET collects data of papers that have run:

  - any **lottery-based RET** (incentivized or not)
  - any **other measure of risk** attitudes (questionnaire, bids in an
    auction, self-reported, implied by behavior in another game
    (insurance, trust…))
  - any **self-declared real-world risky behaviour**.

### Presentation

The methodology and first results of METARET will be the object of a
special [semi-pleanry
session](https://lessac.bsb-education.com/index.php?page=plenary)
organized by me at the [2019 Dijon European ESA
meeting](https://lessac.bsb-education.com/index.php?page=european-esa-meeting-dijon-sept-2019).
Pop by Dijon to learn more.

## Contributed papers (list updates as papers are contributed)

In order to give a feeling of the final product, METARET started from
two papers of mine. More papers whose data is freely available for
download will be soon added.
