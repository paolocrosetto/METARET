**1. The multiple price list by Holt and Laury (HL) (2002)**

Ordered list of binary choices between lotteries, with Option A being safer than Option B. The subjects must make a choice for each pair of lotteries and, if consistent, should at some point switch to the risky option. The switching point captures the risk aversion of the subject. A risk-neutral subject should start with Option A and switch to B from the fifth choice on.

**2. An ordered lottery choice task by Eckel and Grossman (EG) (2002, 2008a)**

In ordered lottery selection tasks, subjects are asked to pick one out of an ordered set of lotteries. Then the lottery is played and the subject paid accordingly. A risk-neutral subject should choose lottery 5, as it yields the higher expected value.

**3. The Investment Game (IG) by Gneezy and Potters (1997)**

Subjects have to decide how to allocate a given endowment of 4 euro between a safe account and a risky investment that yields 2.5 times the amount invested or zero with equal probability. 

**4. Bomb Risk Elicitation Task (BRET) by Crosetto and Filippin (2013)**

Subjects decide how many boxes to collect out of 100, one of which containing a bomb.Earnings increase linearly with the number of boxes accumulated but are zero if the bomb is also collected.


**5. Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) by Lejuez et al. (2002)**

The balloon can pop at any time between the first pump and the maximum balloon size. This means that the balloon can pop on the first pump and will pop with certainty at the maximum balloon size. On each trial the pop point is randomly drawn from a uniform distribution between one and the maximum balloon size. Participants can ‘cash in’ their accumulated tokens before the balloon’s pop point.
