Erkal, Gangadharan, and Koh (2020, J Econ Psych): We used a MPL to elicit certainty equivalence. There were 9 rows in the table, with the certain option always giving 50 ECU for sure. The lottery pays 100 ECU with a p% chance, and 0 ECU otherwise. Across the 9 rows, p increased from 0.1 to 0.9 in intervals of 0.1. The relevant variables are called: RGInputRisky1, â€¦, RGInputRisky9 (9 in total), which equals to 1 if the participant chooses the risky option for the corresponding row, and 0 otherwise.
