# METARET
a Meta Analysis of the External Validity of Risk Elicitation Tasks

## TODOs

- collect more data
- decide if the unity of scrutiny is the paper or the treatment (or both)
- decide how to deal with multiple in (RETs) and multiple out (questionnaires)
- set up the README
- set up the hosted website on github
- clean & update bibtex file, import in R

Once cleared all the above:
- send email to ESA-discuss
- send individual emails to datasets out of ManSci
- collect data and enjoy
