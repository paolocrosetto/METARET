Variables that need to look at the actual paper and parameters:

- stakes: "expected value of the task"; EV gotten by a subject that is risk neutral. [€]

- value of safe option [€]

- share val_safe_option/stakes [float \in (0-1)]


############
Variables that depend on the task only:

- nchoices: nombre de choix [int]

- safe_option: does the task have one or more options with exactly zero variance? [True/False]

- is_50_50: [True/False]

- varying_dimension: categorical variable; probabilities vary; outcomes vary; both vary 
[eg: BRET: both vary; EG: outcoms vary; HL: prob vary; IG: outcome varies]

- has_losses [True/False]

- is_price_list [True/False]

_ is_visual [True/False]

Site layout

1. one page where subjects choose among the above variables, and then a TABLE with mean/st.dev is created by interaction of all the categories. 

2. same but with a dot-whisker plot

3. people choose a configuration of variables, and a REGRESSION is made with an lm() and displayed as a table

4. same, but with coefficient plot

5. difficut: to explore further: generate custom plots given the choices of people.
